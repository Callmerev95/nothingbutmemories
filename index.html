        <br> To my special person: </br>
        <br> I just want to say, I can't believe it's been 9 years, and it will even be 10 years soon. hahaha..
        <br> Maybe I missed a lot of things about you, and I know I can't repeat them. But I hope that when you have free time
        <br> I can listen to whatever I miss from you.</br>
        <br> Ummm, you know what?</br>
        <br> You are still important to me, with or without the conversation.
        <br> You are always in my thoughts.
        <br> Trust me I wanna talk to you all day, but I'm feel like annoying you.
        <br> So, sorry for always bothering you ._. 
        <br> I know this wasn't my best year, but at least I got to see you again, and I'm so happy :)</br>
        <br> By the way I have something for you. . .
